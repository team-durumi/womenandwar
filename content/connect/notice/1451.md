The Korean Council Webinar Series
The Korean Council’s webinar program seeks to provide in-depth and intersectional understanding of the Japanese military sexual slavery issue for transnational English-speaking youth participants. Planned by a transnational youth organizing committee, the webinars will provide a space for remembrance, education, and empowerment for youth who want to learn more about the issue and get involved in the movement for justice.
