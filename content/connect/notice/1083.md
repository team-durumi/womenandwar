8th International Memorial Day for Japanese Military “Comfort Women” Call for International Action

On August 14, 1991, Kim Hak-soon came forward to share her experiences and reveal the war crimes committed by the Japanese military. To remember the courageous testimony of Kim Hak-soon and to work for human rights and dignity of all victims, organizations working for resolution of the Japanese military sexual slavery issue proclaimed August 14 as the International Memorial Day for Japanese Military "Comfort Women" at the 11th Asian Solidarity Conference for Resolution of the Japanese Military "Comfort Women" Issue in 2012. This year, we commemorate the 8th International Memorial Day and 30th year since the movement for just resolution for Japanese military sexual slavery issue started.
The Korean Council plans to hold an International Solidarity Demonstration Press Conference and various related events to commemorate all victims of Japanese military sexual slavery and victims who spoke up and lived as peace and human rights activists (Detailed plans attached at the bottom). To show our solidarity and movement for resolution of the Japanese military sexual slavery issue and prevention of sexual violence in conflict, we kindly ask for your support to:

1. Share your plans for activities via filling out the Google Form (https://bit.ly/2ZrWTa6) by Friday, August 7. The Korean Council will collect and promote the events as International Action and include all participating organizations as co-hosts for the Wednesday Demonstration Press Conference on August 12th!
2. Share a statement of solidarity for the 8th International Memorial Day for Japanese Military "Comfort Women". Having statements of solidarity will help expressing that the victims and organizations stand together for resolution of the issue.
3. Share a video of solidarity messages, on how you will remember, resonate with, and expand voices of Japanese military sexual slavery victims for the 8th International Memorial Day for Japanese Military "Comfort Women".
