On August 11, 2021 at 12PM, we will gather in downtown Chicago in front of the Wrigley Building for a rally and performances in honor of the "comfort women" survivors. You're invited to join us in demanding justice and uplifting their voices! Will you #ComeSitWithHer?

We will be listening to the survivors’ stories, honoring them through art and performance, and marching for justice. Attendees will also have the opportunity to practice their own individual form of embodying justice by sitting with the Statue of Peace or Sonyeosang.

To learn more about Global Action Day and the international movement for the "comfort women" survivors, please visit comfortwomen-justice.com!
