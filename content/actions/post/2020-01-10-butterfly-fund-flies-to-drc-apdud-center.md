After Rebecca Masika Katsuva's death, the Butterfly Fund could not be delivered to her organization APDUD due to challenges in the region.

Yet, the Butterfly Fund's another partner organization REMED delivered the news that the children who became orphans during the war at APDUD Center are being left without any support, sleeping in offices with leaking ceiling. The children could not eat properly or attend school.

The Butterfly Fund flew to APDUD again, in December 2019. The REMED activists visited APDUD to deliver the Butterfly Fund along with food and other support materials for the children. Rachel and Desange Masika who are daughters of the late Masika and are leaders at the APDUD Center, said they miss their late mother more, and hope that the Korean Council and the Butterfly Fund continues to stand in solidarity as their mothers.
