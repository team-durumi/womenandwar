BTS fan club "Run Army (달려라아미)" donates 8,645,857 won to the Hand in Hand with 200,000 Japanese Military Sexual Slavery Victims Fundraising Campaign to support the movement for resolution of the Japanese military sexual slavery issue.

"Run Army (달려라아미)" shared that they have known the Japanese military sexual slavery issue and other crimes of the Japanese colonial period, yet the recent news on the issues of disbandment of the Reconciliation and Healing Foundation (which was founded after the 2015 Korea-Japan Agreement) urged them to support the efforts to remember the history.

Therefore, they organized fundraising campaign to support the Hand in Hand with 200,000 Japanese Military Sexual Slavery Victims Fundraising Campaign and to add to the movement for resolution of the Japanese military sexual slavery issue.

 

We thank the BTS fan club "Run Army (달려라아미)" for their support.
