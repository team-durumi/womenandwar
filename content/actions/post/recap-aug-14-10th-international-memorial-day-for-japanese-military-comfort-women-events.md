On August 14, 1991, Kim Hak-soon halmoni gave a public testimony revealing herself as a victim of Japanese military sexual slavery. Using this date as a marker, the Korean Council for Justice and Remembrance for the Issues of Military Sexual Slavery by Japan created a memorial week for the Japanese Military "Comfort Women." During this week, we held a variety of commemorative events. We co-hosted the Wednesday Demonstration with 87 organizations from 8 different countries on August 10. On Thursday (August 11), we held a free screening of the film _Comfort_, which documents the life of Kim Soon-ak halmoni.   
   
On August 14, the Korean Council held the Butterfly Festival for the 10th International Memorial Day for Japanese Military “Comfort Women." Kwon Hae-hyo, the honorary ambassador for the Korean Council, acted as the MC for various cultural performances. Furthermore, "comfort women" survivors Park Pil-geun, Lee Ok-sun, and Lee Yong-soo shared their hopes for younger generations through a meaningful video. We also organized 20 booths open for public participation conjointly with the Peace Butterfly Network and History Club Association. Thank you to the many student volunteers and citizens who participated in the event despite frequent downpours, as well as those who were unable to join us but still expressed their support.
