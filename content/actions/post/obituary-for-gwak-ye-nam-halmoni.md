11am, March 2nd, 2019, Gwak Ye-nam halmoni from Damyang, South Jeolla Province passed away, leaving only 22 survivors of Japanese military sexual slavery.

Gwak Ye-nam halmoni was born in Damyang, South Jeolla Province in 1925 as the third daughter of a family with two sons and four daughters. She married to avoid the Japanese military's draft of unmarried girls. Yet 2~3 months after her marriage, her sister-in-law was in the danger of being drafted by the Japanese military, so her husband's family wanted to send Gwak Ye-nam halmoni instead. Gwak Ye-nam halmoni ran away to her home, yet a Japanese police officer violently took her shortly after.

In the morning of spring, 1944, she was gathering wild herbs with five other women from the neighborhood when it happened. She was put on a train to China with the women from the neighborhood and 6~7 other women. A year after, Gwak Ye-nam's father passed away in resentment.

For a year and a half, Gwak Ye-nam halmoni suffered from the horrific Japanese military sexual slavery. The comfort station had 24 rooms in two floors, and there were Japanese and Chinese women. Every woman had to wear _kimono_.

Going out of the comfort station was not allowed. Gwak Ye-nam halmoni testified that she rarely stepped outside the comfort station. Going out alone was never allowed, and it was possible to receive the manager's approval when two to three other people accompanied. She could not even think of escaping, since they checked that she was in the room three times a day. She could go to the bathhouse once a week, but still had to be accompanied by the manager.

After liberation of Korea, Gwak Ye-nam halmoni wanted to return home but couldn't. She begged around different houses until she settled in Suzhou, Anhui Province, China. She did not change her Korean nationality while living in China. With the support from the MBC TV program "Exclamation Mark 느낌표" and the Korean Chongshindae's Institute, she was able to restore her Korean nationality and return home to meet her family in 2004. Afterwards, she lived with her nephew (the son of her youngest sister).

When she returned to Korea after 60 years, she could meet her brothers and sisters. Yet her parents already had passed away, missing their lost daughter. Gwak Ye-nam halmoni endured the difficulties in China and held onto her Korean nationality, yet still did not receive a word of apology from the Japanese Government.

Gwak Ye-nam halmoni survived with strength through so many difficulties. We wish she rests in peace.

\*Her funeral home is located in Jeoju Hospital VIP Special Room. Her funeral procession will take place at 9am, March 4th, and she will be buried in the National Cemetery for Overseas Koreans.
