Denial does not rewrite history.

The Japanese Government must apologize to the Japanese military 'comfort women' halmonies as soon as possible.

At the 1365th Wednesday Demonstration on December 12th, students and teachers of Woolim Middle School visited Seoul.

Woolim Middle School donated 2,000,000 won from selling self-designed products at the Japanese military 'comfort women' memorial booth that they organized during a school bazaar with the local community on November 16th.Â 

After participating at the Wednesday Demonstration, students visited the War and Women's Human Rights Museum and attended a lecture on the Japanese military sexual slavery issue.

We thank Woolim Middle School students and teachers for their support for the movement for resolution of the Japanese military sexual slavery issue and for education of the issue through historical and gendered perspectives. The Korean Council will continue its works through your solidarity.
