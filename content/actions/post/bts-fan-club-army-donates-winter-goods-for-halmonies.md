On Sunday, December 16th, the BTS fan club 'Army' donated winter goods to support the victims of Japanese military sexual slavery. 'Army' organized a fundraising event with fans from Korea, the U.S., Japan, Europe, and Central/South America from November 9th to November 30th.

'Army' shared that it was the fans' wish to support halmonies through the cold winter. 'Army' also promised to continue to stand in solidarity with the victims.

We truly thank 'Army' for their continued support since October when they donated to the Hands in Hands with 200,000 Japanese Military Sexual Slavery Victims campaign. The Korean Council will deliver the support that fans across the world show for halmonies through December visits.
