We welcome the South Korean Court’s historic ruling for resolution of the Japanese military “comfort women” issue!

Seoul Central District Court (Civil Chamber 34, presiding judge, Kim Jeong-gon) announced its historic ruling today, recognizing the Japanese Government’s responsibilities to make reparations to the Japanese military sexual slavery (“comfort women”) victims.

This ruling is not only consistent with the constitutional order of the Republic of Korea, but also a pioneering lead in confirming the principle of human rights under the international human rights law. Today’s ruling has opened a new horizon for human rights protection that not only domestic courts but also courts around the world can emulate. We sincerely welcome the South Korean court's decision to fulfill its responsibilities as the "last bastion of human rights" by listening to the desperate appeals of the victims.

Victims have revealed the crimes of Japanese military sexual slavery through countless public testimonies and have called for just resolution based on principles of victim-centered approach, yet were shunned repeatedly. The Japanese Court dismissed victim’s calls for justice, excusing the Japanese Government’s responsibilities behind the 1965 Treaty. The victims were completely excluded in the so-called 2015 Korea-Japan agreement. Even after the 2015 Korea-Japan agreement, the Japanese Government distorted historical facts and denied the Japanese military sexual slavery itself. Further, the Japanese Government latches on its attempts to erase the Japanese military “comfort women” issue through interfering with establishment of Statue of Peace around the world, which is a symbol of women’s human rights and peace.

As the perpetrator constantly denies its crimes and other effective forms of remedy are absent, the victims knocked on the door of the South Korean Court with a desperation of last hope. The ruling is a South Korean Court's response that did not to turn a blind eye to the victims’ final appeal. It is a clear declaration that when one’s human rights are seriously violated as in the case of Japanese military sexual slavery, the principles of human dignity, value, right to access justice and universal human rights take precedence over the excuse of state immunity.

Many of the plaintiffs have passed away while the trial took place, and only five of them survive today. We have no time to lose. The Japanese Government should make reparations according to the ruling without delay. Furthermore, Japanese Government should admit the Japanese military sexual slavery issue, which is regarded as one of the gravest violations of human rights in the 20th century, apologize and commemorate sincerely, investigate the truth, and educate history, to fulfill its “legal responsibilities.”

We believe today’s historic ruling will serve as a compass for just resolution of the issue, and be respected again on January 13, with the Seoul Central District Court (Civil Chamber 15, presiding judge, Min Seong-cheol) decision for another lawsuit filed by victims.
