**Aug 14 9th International Memorial Day for Japanese Military "Comfort Women"**

**1\. Purpose**

August 14, 2021 marks the 30th anniversary of Kim Hak-soon's courageous testimony. Kim Hak-soon’s public testimony unearthed the truth that was buried in silence, awoke the victims around the world, and contributed to restoring their dignity and human rights. Kim Hak-soon’s testimony urged the global civic society to end impunity of sexual violence and fight for realization of universal women’s human rights. Through Kim Hak-soon’s voice, the international community was able to re-write the principles of women’s human rights to prevent recurrence of wartime sexual violence and establish principles of international law.

The Korean Council organizes various events to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Kim Hak-soon's courageous testimony and 9th International Memorial Day for Japanese Military “Comfort Women”: International Conference to reflect on history and implications of Kim Hak-soon’s testimony and to seek tasks and directions of the movement in the future, Talk Concert with first generation activists who met with Kim Hak-soon, Wednesday Demonstration and Butterfly Festival, and Commemorative Exhibition.

We cordially ask the organizations in solidarity to join the events and show our continued fight to commemorate the victim-survivors and create a peaceful world to the Japanese government and international community.

**2\. Theme**

Kim Hak-soon's courage awakes the world! Now we will change the world!
