At the 1365th and 1366th Wednesday Demonstrations, students from Janggok Middle School shared drawings and poems to remember the Japanese military sexual slavery victims' activism that they learned about.

The students also delivered 2,034,510 won to support the resolution of the Japanese military sexual slavery issue.

We thank the Janggok Middle School students for their continued support and for seeing the Japanese military sexual slavery issue through historical and gender perspectives.
