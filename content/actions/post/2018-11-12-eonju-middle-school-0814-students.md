14 students of a student club called #0814 at Eonju Middle School in Gangnam, Seoul, visited Peaceful Our Home and donated 1,100,000 won to the Hand in Hand with 200,000 Japanese Military Sexual Slavery Victims Fundraising Campaign on November 9th. The students created badges to remember the Japanese military sexual slavery issue and stand in solidarity with halmonis until the Japanese government gives formal apology and legal reparations.

With the teacher Mr. Chung Dae-won, the students also prepared mufflers and flowers for Kim Bok-dong and Gil Won-ok halmonis. They read a letter that students wrote thinking of halmonis and a poem to tell halmonis that the students will search for the long-lost time and stand next to halmonis till the end.

Although the students were unable to meet Kim Bok-dong halmoni who was then in hospital, Gil Won-ok halmoni shared that they "should study diligently to help resolve the issue and to make the country into a better place" and performed a song for them. The student club #0814 has donated three times since 2016.

We once again thank the #0814 students and Mr. Chung Dae-won for remembering the painful history of halmonis and standing together in solidarity for resolution of the Japanese military sexual slavery issue.
