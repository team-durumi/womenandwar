\[Obituary\]

Dutch-Australian victim of the Japanese military sexual slavery Jan Ruff-O’Herne halmoni passed away in Adelaide, Australia, at the age of 96 in the morning of August 19th, 2019.

Jan Ruff-O’Herne halmoni was training to become a nun in Dutch East Indies (Indonesia), when the Japanese military forced her into the prison-of-war camp in 1942. Then she was forced into Japanese military sexual slavery in 1944, and suffered from repeated sexual violence for months in the comfort station named “House of Seven Seas 七海亭”, which was established by the Japanese military in Java Island, Indonesia.

After the war ended, she married to an English officer and moved to Australia in 1960. Seeing the news about Kim Hak-soon halmoni’s public testimony on being a Japanese military “comfort women” victim, Jan Ruff-O’Herne halmoni came forward to share her story with her family and the Australian media in 1992. Ever since she came forward, she stood in solidarity with the victims across Asia-Pacific region.

In December 1992, she testified at the International Public Hearing on Japanese War Crimes in Tokyo, Japan. In 1994, she published her personal memoir titled <Fifty Years of Silence>, and in 2000, testified at the Women's International War Crimes Tribunal on Japan's Military Sexual Slavery in Tokyo, Japan.

In 2007, she testified during the US congressional hearing, therefore contributing to the passing of the United States House Resolution 121 to call for the Japanese Government to take legal responsibilities. Her active movement promoted the truth of the Japanese military “comfort women” issue across Europe and the U.S.

Together with Korean victims Jang Jeom-dol and Gil Won-ok, she engaged in active movement for resolution of the Japanese military sexual slavery issue in Melbourne, Sydney, and other places in Australia as well.

The Korean Council feels heartbroken upon hearing that Jan Ruff-O’Herne halmoni, who has long fought for the Japanese Government’s recognition of war crimes, official apology, and legal reparations, passed away. We hope that where she rests will be a peaceful world without war and without sexual violence. We will continue her hopes to achieve just resolution of the Japanese military sexual slavery, through the perpetrator Japanese Government’s sincere apology.

The Korean Council for Justice and Remembrance for the Issues of Military Sexual Slavery by Japan shares our deepest condolences to all of Jan Ruff-O’Herne halmoni’s families, friends, and citizens of Australia who stood in solidarity with her, and stands together in sending Jan Ruff-O’Herne halmoni.

As a survivor of the Japanese military sexual slavery, Jan Ruff-O’Herne halmoni publicly testified her painful experiences in 1992. She said she gained strength from the Korean victims who courageously demanded apology in front of the Japanese Embassy that remains unmoved, and determined to devote herself to stop the painful history from repeating itself.

Afterwards, Jan Ruff-O’Herne halmoni testified at the International Public Hearing on Japanese War Crimes in Tokyo, Japan in December 1992, at the Women's International War Crimes Tribunal on Japan's Military Sexual Slavery in Tokyo, Japan in 2000, and at the U.S. congressional hearing in 2007, which in turn led to the passing of the United States House Resolution 121. Her testimony promoted the truth of the Japanese military “comfort women” issue in the international community including Europe, U.S., and others.

Moreover, together with Korean victims Jang Jeom-dol and Gil Won-ok, she engaged in active movement for resolution of the Japanese military sexual slavery issue in Melbourne, Sydney, and other places in Australia.

Jan Ruff-O’Herne halmoni fought for just resolution of the Japanese military sexual slavery issue, and promoted international awareness that the Japanese military sexual slavery issue is not only an issue confined in East Asia, but also an issue of universal human rights.

Jan Ruff-O’Herne halmoni, we will remember your suffering.

We will remember your courage and fight for the Japanese Government’s recognition of war crimes, official apology, and legal reparations.

We hope that you rest in a peaceful world without war and without sexual violence.

We will continue your works to achieve just resolution of the Japanese military sexual slavery, through the perpetrator Japanese Government’s sincere apology.

We will continue your works to achieve a peaceful world, where wartime sexual violence does not occur anymore.

We pray that you rest in peace.
