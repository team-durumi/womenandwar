The Korean Council’s path and its future plans

We strive to be united. We will partner with national and international civic organizations. In solidarity, we will reveal the truth about Japanese military sexual slavery, and we will not rest until justice is achieved.

Commemoration and education will continue to be a top priority. We will continue our research and education programs to ensure that accurate historical information is preserved for future generations.

Communication will continue, and we hope that you will continue to place your faith in us. Our organization and its accounting management will be as transparent. We also hope to host more activities that will increase communication with citizens.
