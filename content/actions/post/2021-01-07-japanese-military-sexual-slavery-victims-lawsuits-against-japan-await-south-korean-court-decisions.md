**Lawsuits against the Japanese Government in Korean Court await decisions in January, 2021**  
Japanese military sexual slavery victims have sought legal responsibilities of the Japanese Government by filing lawsuits in Japan since 1990s and respective countries in Asia-Pacific regions. Yet denial and dismissal of the Japanese Government led the victims and activists to organize a people's tribunal 2000 Women's International War Crimes Tribunal to clearly state the responsibilities. In 2011, the Constitutional Court of Korea had ruled that the Korean Government's inaction for resolution of the issue is unconstitutional.

In January, the lawsuits filed by victims and families in January 2016, after the 2015 "Comfort Women" Agreement, will receive the first decisions in the Korean Court. We call for the Korean Court to respect the decisions of the 2000 Women's Tribunal and 2011 Constitutional Court, reports and recommendations of the United Nations, and numerous resolutions passed in countries including the U.S., Netherlands, Canada, European Parliament, Korea, Taiwan, and regional assemblies in Japan.
