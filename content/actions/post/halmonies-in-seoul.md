The Korean Council visited two halmonies in Seoul.

Yoon halmoni pulled out a tooth recently. Her face was a bit swollen and she had pain in the cheek, yet she was more energetic than usual.

Her daughter made vegetable juice and cut apples, and halmoni told us that apples are much tastier than vegetable juice. Halmoni loves the color white, so she only eats food that are white and tells others to do so as well.

We brought beef to be put in halmoni's porridge. Halmoni eats more than usual when there is beef in the porridge. We told her that we will visit again soon in January.

Â 

Yang halmoni stays in the nursing home. She was watching TV alone, and her eyes became wider as she saw us coming in. She was more energetic than usual and shared different stories with us. She asked if we ate, told us to sit down and rest, and led the conversation.

When we told her that we will visit again soon, she stayed quiet and started showing tears. She was never like this before, so it was difficult for us to leave her. We held her hands and told her several times that we will visit again soon, until halmoni was okay to bid us good-bye.

We hope that halmonies don't feel lonely.
