**General comment**

Events for the 1500th Wednesday Demonstration on July 14 and International Memorial Day for Japanese Military "Comfort Women" and 30th anniversary of Kim Hak-soon's public testimony on August 14 were broadly covered. The Japanese Prime Minister Suga announced to step down, and Statue of Peace exhibitions in Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto faced backlash and blackmailing from the revisionist right wing groups. While commemorative statue in Hong Kong was removed, Berlin Statue of Peace secured its place for another year, to which the Japanese government immediately reacted.
