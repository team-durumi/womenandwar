The Korean Council for Justice and Remembrance for the Issues of Military Sexual Slavery by Japan calls for nomination of individuals or organizations for the 2020 KIM BOK DONG Peace Prize. KIM BOK DONG Peace Prize honors individuals or organizations that have been engaged in the movement to resolve the issue of sexual violence in armed conflict and ensure women’s human rights in armed conflict across the world.

**Establishment Background**

After her testimony as a Japanese military sexual slavery victim in 1992, KIM BOK DONG has been in the center of the movement for resolution of the Japanese military sexual slavery issue and supported victims of sexual violence in conflict till she passed away on January 28th, 2019. When she won the Women’s Human Rights Award from the Foundation for Justice and Remembrance for the Issue of Military Sexual Slavery by Japan on November 25th, 2017, she donated the prize money to be used for “the future generation to remember the lives of victims who have fought for resolution of the Japanese military sexual slavery issue and to support victims of sexual violence in armed conflict across the world.”

The Korean Council established the KIM BOK DONG Peace Prize to follow KIM BOK DONG’s spirit for peace and women’s human rights and to commemorate the International Day for the Elimination of Sexual Violence in Conflict (June 19). The Korean Council aims to raise international awareness of sexual violence in armed conflict and to encourage victims to become a part of women’s human rights movement by providing support to them until the violence against women in armed conflict ends. The Korean Council hopes that the KIM BOK DONG Peace Prize could give all women’s human rights organizations and activists an opportunity to remember everyone who has been engaged in the movement to end sexual violence in armed conflict.

The 1st KIM BOK DONG Peace Prize was awarded to Acan Sylvia Obal (Golden Women Vision in Uganda) who supports victims of the Lord’s Resistance Army Insurgency in Uganda, and the 2nd KIM BOK DONG Peace Prize went to Vasfije Krasniqi-Goodman (Kosova Rehabilitation Centre for Torture Victims), a Kosovo War survivor and activist.
