A to Z Guide for Just Resolution of the Japanese Military Sexual Slavery Issue (2020) is available!

"How can the Japanese military 'comfort women' issue be resolved?"

Throughout our movement, citizens, researchers, students, journalists, and more have asked what just resolution to the issue means.

Answering various and symbolic questions on the issue and commemorating the 30th anniversary of the movement for just resolution of the Japanese military sexual slavery issue and the Korean Council, we have created an informational booklet on the Japanese military sexual slavery ("comfort women") issue.

The booklet introduces the unstoppable call for justice that the victims and citizens have continued, fighting against denial and distortion of history.

Please share the news and read together with your families and friends!
