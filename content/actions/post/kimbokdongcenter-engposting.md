WHAT IS KIM BOK DONG CENTER?

Commemorating Kim Bok Dong halmoni who passed away on January 28th, 2019, and the 30th year of the movement for resolution of the Japanese military "comfort women" issue, the Korean Council will establish KIM BOK DONG CENTER to follow the messages of peace and hope that Kim Bok Dong shared and to remember history and courageous activism of the Japanese military sexual slavery victims.

The KIM BOK DONG CENTER will have online/offline archives, exhibition on the issues of Japanese military sexual slavery and wartime sexual violence, educational spaces, and others to offer education on the history of Japanese military "comfort women" issue and to stand in solidarity with the victims who courageously came forward, and called for justice : the Japanese Government's official apology and legal reparations.
