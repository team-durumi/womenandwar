The discussion-based women's human rights and peace education instructor training program took place since September 3rd to December 7th, 2018.

Last class shared ways to use the book <25 Years of Wednesday; 25년간의 수요일> for discussions, plans to continue the instructors' meetings, and thoughts from the training program.

In the past 3 months, the trainees learned about and discussed the Japanese military sexual slavery issue, human rights, and peace. The trainees had an opportunity to look at the Japanese military 'comfort women' issue not  only as a painful history but also as an issue that contains historical truth and potentials to develop and continue discussions.

We thank 17 trainees who completed the program and sincerely hope that everyone can become great instructors.
