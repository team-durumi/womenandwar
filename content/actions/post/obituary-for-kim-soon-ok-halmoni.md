Kim Soon-ok halmoni passed away around 9am on December 5th, 2018.

Kim Soon-ok halmoni was born in Pyongyang in 1922. To help her family, she worked since she was 7 years old.

When she was 20 years old, she was told that she can work at a factory and earn money. She was taken to China with 30~40 women and suffered from sexual slavery in Heilongjiang, China.

After Korea was liberated, she tried to return home, but did not know the way back home. She stayed in China until 2005 when she finally came back to Korea.

Kim Soon-ok halmoni stayed in the House of Sharing and participated in the movement for resolution of the Japanese military sexual slavery issue. She testified in Korea and abroad and voiced her experiences during Wednesday Demonstrations.

Despite the long period of sickness, she always welcomed everyone with a smile. Yet her exacerbating health conditions took to heaven.

Please rest in peace, Kim Soon-ok halmoni.
