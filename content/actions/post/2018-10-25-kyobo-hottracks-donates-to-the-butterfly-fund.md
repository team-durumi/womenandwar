KYOBO HOTTRACKS, a company that offers designer stationery, digital goods, and music albums, created and sold a badge dedicated to the Japanese military sexual slavery victims in August, 2018. They donated 3,000,000 won to the Butterfly Fund that supports victims of sexual violence in conflict.

 

KYOBO HOTTRACKS shared that they "respect the messages of victims who have worked for just resolution of the Japanese military sexual slavery issue and want to support Kim Bok-dong and Gil Won-ok halmonis' actions to stand in solidarity with other victims of sexual violence in conflict". They shared tat the donations could support the movement in a meaningful way.

The Butterfly Fund supports the victims of sexual violence in conflict. We thank KYOBO HOTTRACKS staffs and customers who have support the campaign.
