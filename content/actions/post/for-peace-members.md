For Peace 포피스 is an non-profit organization that organizes programs for peace education. Children members of For Peace watched _I Can Speak_ 아이캔스피크, discussed the Japanese military sexual slavery issue, and wrote Christmas cards for Japanese military 'comfort women' halmonies.

They also made butterfly accessories through pixel art and clay and sent them to the Korean Council as a message of solidarity with halmonies.

We thank For Peace members for the cards, butterflies, and solidarity.
