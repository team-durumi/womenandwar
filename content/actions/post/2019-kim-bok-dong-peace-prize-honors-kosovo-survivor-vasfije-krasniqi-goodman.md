?2019 Kim Bok-dong Peace Prize honors Kosovo survivor Vasfije Krasniqi-Goodman?

The Korean Council for Justice and Remembrance for the Issues of Military Sexual Slavery by Japan (The Korean Council) has selected Kosovo survivor Vasfije Krasniqi-Goodman as the winner of 2019 Kim Bok-dong Peace Prize. Kim Bok-dong Peace Prize honors individuals or organizations that have been engaged in the movement to resolve the wartime sexual violence issue and ensure women’s human rights in armed conflict across the world, following the spirit of the Japanese military sexual slavery victim Kim Bok-dong.

  
Vasfije is an activist at the Kosova Rehabilitation Centre for Torture Victims (KRCT) that advocates for the rights of victims of wartime sexual violence. Vasfije was the first person to publically narrate her trauma of sexual violence during Kosovo War. She was raped by Serbian police when she was 16 years old, and has since continued the movement for realization of justice through punishment of the perpetrators and various events including public speak-outs, Be My Voice Campaign for the victims of wartime sexual violence to share their voices, and Stand Speak Rise Up Campaign. She gave testimonies at the UN Human Rights Council and received Honorable Citizen Award by the president of Kosovo.

  
Vasfije met with Japanese military sexual slavery victims Kim Bok-dong and Gil Won-ok during her visit to Korea for the 6th International Memorial Day for Japanese Military “Comfort Women.” Inspired by the courage and movement of the victims, Vasfije testified her experience during the international symposium and gave joint statement with survivors from Uganda, DR Congo, and Yazidis for resolution of the Japanese military sexual slavery issue and wartime sexual violence. 

  
The award ceremony will take place during the 1392nd Wednesday Demonstration for resolution of the Japanese military sexual slavery issue and elimination of sexual violence in conflict, on June 19th, in front of the Japanese Embassy. The winner will receive a plaque and 5,000USD. Vasfije will participate in the Elimination of Sexual Violence in Conflict Week events organized by the Korean Council from June 17th to June 19th, and give case presentation during the international symposium on June 18th.

\*Establishment Background of Kim Bok-dong Peace Prize  
The Korean Council established the Kim Bok-dong Peace Prize to follow the Japanese military sexual slavery victim Kim Bok-dong’s spirit for peace and women’s human rights and to commemorate the International Day for the Elimination of Sexual Violence in Conflict (19 June). The Korean Council aims to raise international awareness of sexual violence in armed conflict and to encourage victims to become a part of women’s human rights movement by providing support to them until the violence against women in armed conflict ends. The Korean Council hopes that the Kim Bok-dong Peace Prize could give all women’s human rights organizations and activists an opportunity to remember everyone who has been engaged in the movement to end sexual violence in armed conflict.
