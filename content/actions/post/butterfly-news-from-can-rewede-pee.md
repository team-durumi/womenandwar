The Korean Council supports victims of sexual violence by the Lord's Resistance Army during the Uganda Insurgency, with Butterfly Fund!

Can Rewede Pee is a group of survivors who live in Gulu, Uganda.

Through the Butterfly Fund, Can Rewede Pee supported 7 primary/elementary school students, 5 students in 4th grade, 8 students in 6th grade. They are also planning to build a grass thatched house in December, since they do not have a meeting place, other than the tree in center of the village or the house of another resident.

Stand in solidarity with victims of sexual violence in conflict through Butterfly Fund!?
