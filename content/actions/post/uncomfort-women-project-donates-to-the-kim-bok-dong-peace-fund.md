On December 20th, the 'UnComfort Women' Project (HS ad, HS 애드) visited Peaceful Our Home and donated 5,000,000 won to the Kim Bok-dong Peace Fund.

The 'UnComfort Women' Project ([http://uncomfortwomen.com/](http://uncomfortwomen.com/)) is a social movement in which anyone can upload their photo and establish the Statue of Peace in a location of their choice through the Geotag on Instagram. Thanks to its creativity and accessibility, the 'UnComfort Women' Project won the Korea Advertising Awards.

The 'UnComfort Women' Project team decided to donate the prize to the Kim Bok-dong Peace Fund that supports survivors of sexual violence in conflict and the future generation. They met with Kim Bok-dong and Gil Won-ok halmonies at Peaceful Our Home and delivered the fund.

We thank the 'UnComfort Women' Project team for using their valuable talents to support the Japanese military sexual slavery issue and prevention of sexual violence in conflict.
