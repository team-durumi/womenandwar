Are you involved in activism on the Japanese military "comfort women" issue? Looking for an opportunity to be further involved in the movement?

Join the organizing committee of the Korean Council's webinar program for youth activists! We are organizing English webinar series to provide opportunities for youth activists to educate themselves further on the Japanese military sexual slavery issue. We hope to collaborate with youth activists around the world in planning this initiative. We'll hold 4 short meetings in July/August to plan webinar topics, structure, and speakers. Anyone in their 10s-30s interested in planning educational webinars on the Japanese military sexual slavery issue are welcome to join us!
