On September 22nd, the Korean Council participated in the 4th Conference on World War II in the Philippines, which was organized by the Bataan Legacy Historical Society to educate the war crimes of the Japanese Imperial Military to the younger generation and to remember and restore the victims' human rights.

The Korean Council had the opportunity to listen to the experiences of teachers who educated the issues of war crimes, watched videos created by students on the Japanese military sexual slavery issue and Bataan Death March, and to discuss ways to educate the war crimes of the Japanese Imperial Military during the World War II.

Yoon Meehyang, representative of the Korean Council, gave a special speech.

In the afternoon, the Korean Council enjoyed the last day of _Truth & Justice: Remembering “Comfort W__omen”_ exhibition. Students of the San Francisco State University, former member of the U.S. House of Representatives Mike Honda, who promoted awareness of and supported the Japanese military sexual slavery issue through resolutions calling for the Japanese government's actions, and parents of Iris Chang, the author of _The Rape of Nanking,_ visited the exhibition.

The Korean Council also had a meeting with San Francisco One Heart for Justice, an organization that works on the Sewol Ferry Disaster, Japanese military sexual slavery issue, and other social issues in San Jose and San Francisco.
