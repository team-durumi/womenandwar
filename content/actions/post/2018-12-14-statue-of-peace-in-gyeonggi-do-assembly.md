On December 14th, the Gyeonggi-do Assembly unveiled the Statue of Peace.

It is the first Statue of Peace to be installed in local government, and the members of the assembly played an important role to establish the statue.

Yoon Mee-hyang, representative of the Korean Council, gave a congratulatory speech.

The Statue of Peace gave an opportunity for everyone who attended to remember the Japanese military sexual slavery issue and think about the dignity and peace that every human being deserves.
