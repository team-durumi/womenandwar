Kyunghee University student club 'Nabi (나비)' and 14 students of the Dongdaemun youth volunteer program 'Seumteo (세움터)' donated 500,000 won to the Butterfly Fund to support the victims of sexual violence in conflict on November 10th.

The middle school students who participated in 'Seumteo (세움터)' program created and sold mirrors, badges, and other goods in local markets and festivals. The students donated the fund and goods and recorded their movement at the War and Women's Human Rights Museum. 

After the ceremony, the students visited the War and Women's Human Rights Museum and listened to a lecture to reflect on the meanings of their movement.

The Korean Council will remember the actions of the students and continue to work towards the resolution of the Japanese military sexual slavery issue.
