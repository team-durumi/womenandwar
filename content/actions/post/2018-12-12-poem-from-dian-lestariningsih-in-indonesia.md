Ms. Dian Lestariningsih, from Indonesia, participated in the Wednesday Demonstrations held in Korea several times.

Singing the Wednesday Demonstration opening song "Like A Rock" and learning about the stories of halmonies encouraged her to share her feelings and thoughts through poems.

In "I Feel You", she expressed understanding for halmonies,

In "Thank You", she expressed gratitude for halmonies' courage.

We hope that all of us can read the beautiful poems and think about each of us can do to stand in solidarity with halmonies.
