\[Obituary\] Yoon halmoni

Yoon halmoni, who lived in Seoul, passed away around 10 p.m. last night.

Yoon halmoni was born in North Chungcheong Province in 1929. In 1941, when she was 13 years old (in Korean age), she saw her grandfather being assaulted by Japanese soldiers who came to her house on a truck. She resisted, but was put on the truck with her youngest aunt, who was over 20 years old and was staying home after her fianc√© was taken for forced labor after receiving the wedding day. Yoon halmoni was taken to Shimonoseki, Japan, where she worked for a textile company for about three years. Then, she was taken to a comfort station where she suffered from sexual slavery.

After liberation, she was swept away by people and went to Shimonoseki, where she returned to Busan by ship. Both her body and mind were hurt for rest of her life.

In 1993, she registered as a victim of Japanese military sexual slavery to the Korean government and actively took part in the testimonies and Wednesday Demonstration for just resolution of the Japanese military sexual slavery issue.

We wish Yoon halmoni may rest in peace.

Funerals will be held confidentially according to the wishes of halmoni and bereaved families.
