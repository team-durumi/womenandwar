**🦋 News Briefing (Feb-Apr 2022)**  
 General comment

Another halmoni passed away in February, leaving 12 survivors in Korea.  
  
Despite the National Human Rights Commission of Korea’s recommendation for the police to ensure the safety of the Wednesday Demonstration, the history revisionists’ backlash continues in both Korea and globally. Harvard Law Professor Ramseyer published another article to respond to critics, which led to additional condemnation by the researchers and students. 

Conservative candidate Yoon Seok-yeol’s victory in the South Korean presidential election was welcomed by right-wing and Japanese media that claim it’s “good time to move beyond” the historical issues, while concerns on hate speech and discrmiantion are on the rise. Japan’s Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology announced evaluation results on high school history textbooks, in which references to the Japanese government’s responsibility in forced labor and Japanese military sexual slavery victims were erased.

The Statue of Peace exhibition in Tokyo, Japan received thousands of visitors, despite the backlash and attacks of right-wingers. The Statue of Peace served as a symbol of Asian American solidarity during the commemoration of 1 year after the Atlanta shooting and strives to find a home in Berlin, Germany and Philadelphia, U.S. as well.
