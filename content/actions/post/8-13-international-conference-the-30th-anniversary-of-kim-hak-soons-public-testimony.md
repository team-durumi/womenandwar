**□ Purpose** 

August 14, 2021 marks the 30th anniversary of Japanese military sexual slavery victim-survivor Kim Hak-soon’s first public testimony. Kim Hak-soon’s courageous public testimony revealed the truth that had been silenced and inspired victim-survivors around the world to come forward, contributing to redress for victim-survivors. This testimony also raised wartime sexual violence to the international community as a universal issue of women's rights and opened the stage for civil movements to address it. As a result, the international community has renewed human rights standards and rewritten the history of global human rights from a woman’s perspective.

Even though 30 years had passed since Kim Hak-soon’s courageous public testimony, Japan continues to evade legal responsibility, to organize systemic campaigns to remove the Statues of Peace, and to deny the historical truth. The ultra-right and history revisionists are expanding their activities as well. In this situation, we need to seek new directions on the ways in which we remember, extend, and inherit victim-survivors’ testimonies.

The Korean Council for Justice and Remembrance for the Issues of Military Sexual Slavery by Japan hold an international conference on Friday, August 13th in commemoration of August 14 International Memorial Day for Japanese Military “Comfort Women.” This conference aims to spread the truth on the Japanese military sexual slavery issue and to discuss the implications of victim-survivors’ activism in multi-dimensional perspectives. Long-time experts and researchers of new generation in this field will engage in serious discussions beyond the various barriers of generation, country, nation, and language. We kindly ask for your attention and participation.
