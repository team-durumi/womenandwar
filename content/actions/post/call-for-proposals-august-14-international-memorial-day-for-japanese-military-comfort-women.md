**Call for Proposals:**

**August 14 International Memorial Day for Japanese Military “Comfort Women”**

This year marks the 30th year since Kim Hak-soon’s courageous public testimony on August 14, 1991. Kim Hak-soon’s public testimony contributed to restoration of human rights and dignity of the victims by unearthing the truth from silence. It also evoked values of universal women’s human rights in the civic society and rewrote the international human rights principles for prevention of sexual violence in conflict with experiences and voices of victims.

The Korean Council for Justice and Remembrance for the Issues of Military Sexual Slavery by Japan (hereinafter the Korean Council) aims to support activities and events to promote the historical truth of the Japanese military sexual slavery issue, to spread the meanings of victims’ voices, and to fight against the denial of the Japanese government and historical revisionists.
