Women and War: Voices for Peace seeks to remember and honour the survivors of military sexual abuse during the Imperial Japanese colonisation of the Asia-Pacific, also known as ‘Comfort Women’.

The exhibition highlights the transformation of the survivors from victims to peace and human rights activists. This is timely in the wake of the global [#MeToo](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/metoo) movement and the ongoing horror of gender-based violence faced by women, particularly in conflict zones around the world.

The exhibition aims to amplify the voices of the survivors who continue to raise their voices for a world without war and gender-based violence.

Photos presented in this exhibition are provided by ‘War and Women’s Human Rights Museum in South Korea, which was founded by [정의기억연대 Justice for the 'Comfort Women'](https://www.facebook.com/womenandwar/), an organisation which has been supporting survivors across the Asia-Pacific in their decades-long fight for justice.
