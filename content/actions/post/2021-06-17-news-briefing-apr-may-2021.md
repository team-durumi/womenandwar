### **General comment**

The 4/21 Seoul Central District Court ruling had rejected the survivors’ voices for justice, contradicting the earlier 1/8 court ruling. Many news articles and editorials reported on the ruling from a diplomatic perspective, assessing the potential impact of the ruling on Korea-Japan relations. Further, the Japanese government and historical revisionists continue to demand removal of Statue of Peace established by citizens around the world. This leaves us with the following questions: Where are the survivors’ voices in these news articles? Are the survivors being heard by the judiciary and the media? We need to challenge the media for its lack of human rights perspectives and victim-centered approaches.

Scholars such as Chelsea Szendi Scheider (author of first article) and her colleagues who wrote [a comprehensive rebuttal to Ramseyer’s article](https://sites.google.com/view/concernedhistorians) had been attacked by Japanese right-wing _neto uyo._ This group promotes revisionist history on social media while threatening researchers. Ramseyer himself feeds off of such revisionists and had even gone so far as to openly admit that discussing the issues of Korean, Burakumin, and Okinawans in Japan allows him to make offensive remarks about minorities while avoiding the backlash he would receive if similar statements were made about American minority issues. The third article details victim-survivor Kim Soon-duk’s visit to the United States to raise awareness of the issue, and stresses the importance of remembering the history.

📌 Statue of Peace

The first article details the struggles of establishing the Statue of Peace in Berlin, including the Japanese government’s pressures to remove the statue and the efforts of local activists to keep the symbol of peace and remember the atrocities so as to not repeat it again. In Aurora, CO, USA, a proposal to establish the statue of peace was voted down by the city council, while in Tokyo, an exhibition featuring a statue of peace is scheduled to open on June 25th.
