Korean Women's Association in Singapore donated 3,000,000 won to the Butterfly Fund to support the victims of sexual violence in conflict across the world.

For their prior event on the Japanese military sexual slavery issue, Kim Bok-dong halmoni shared a video of support.

We thank the Korean Women's Association in Singapore again for their visit to Korea and donation.
