**News Briefing (Sep-Oct 2021)**  
 Kishida, who spearheaded the 2015 “comfort women” agreement as then foreign minister, became the 100th prime minister of Japan. The Berlin District Office decided to keep the Berlin Statue of Peace for another year after continued efforts of civic groups and citizens, yet Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said that the government will continue to seek the statue's removal, saying, "This is not acceptable. We have strongly protested it." "There are multiple cases in which attempts (to install statues) ended after we took various actions to gain people's understanding." Meanwhile, the New York Times published the obituary of Kim Hak-soon and artworks remembering victim-survivors’ stories were published around the world. The Wednesday Demonstration finally has participants on site due to the lifting of COVID19 restrictions, but the revisionists who stage anti-protest threaten to take over the site and spread hate speech, calling for our solidarity!
