On December 20th, we arrived to Pohang first. Although we urged halmoni not to come out to greet us in such a cold weather, she was waiting for us outside. She told us that someone from the city government visited her. We sat down in her room and showed her the gifts that the Korean Council and citizens prepared, from rice, meat, warm jackets, socks, cooking oils, to cosmetics. Although halmoni speaks in fast, local dialect, we were able to understand her.

We went to her favorite restaurant and had lunch together. She did not leave a single drop and was content. Since halmoni stays alone and has to prepare all of her meals on her own, we always worry that she won’t be able to eat properly. We truly appreciate that we can eat out with her during our visits. After we took halmoni home, she stayed outside to bid us goodbye.

Next, we visited Kim, Kyung-ae halmoni in Changwon. Halmoni held each of our hands. She was more energetic than usual, and she un-wrapped the gifts and read the letters on her own.

In fact, halmoni has as new family member. Halmoni’s daughter adopted an abandoned dog named Hani. Hani jumps around everywhere, making everyone adore her. Halmoni also smiles at Hani, and we all believe that Hani will be a great partner for halmoni. We promised that we will visit again in January to halmoni who waved goodbye.

As usual, Kim halmoni prepared sweet potatoes, eggs, bananas, tangerines, and yogurt, and waited for our visit. She said she was sick recently, and her face was a bit swollen. She had a cold and diarrhea, but she feels better now and in fact got a perm the day before. She loved the jacket and socks. After eating the snacks and talking with her, halmoni came outside to bid us goodbye.

Kim, Yang-ju halmoni was lying on the bed, but she greeted us with her eyes wide open. We washed our hands thoroughly to hold hers. Halmoni’s hands were as soft as those of a baby. Yet she grasped our hands with such energy. We held her hands and cheered her up.

On December 21st, we met Kwak, Ye-nam halmoni in Damyang, Chellanam-do. She was in the hospital for a month and now is back home, but she still does not have much energy. She didn’t laugh or looked good. Yet she tries to stay healthy through eating ginseng. We hope that we can see her smile next time.
