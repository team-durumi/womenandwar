\[Donation by Joe Chan\] In Celebration of CLC Oh Seunghee's birthday  
As a Chinese, Joe has heard a lot about his grandparents' suffering during the Japanese aggression in World War II since his childhood. Joe emphasizes that people should understand how disgraceful it is for the Japanese militarist to deny such war crime and should never forget the pain they have inflicted to both of our nations and across Asia-Pacific region.Joe came across the work that the Korean Council has been doing for the living victims and decided to do something about it. He donated KRW951010 to the Council and would like to dedicate this donation to Oh Seunghee from girl group CLC, as a gift for her birthday.

  
Oh Seunghee and CLC groupmates have been constantly participating in charitable work ever since before their debut. Their kindness and generosity have motivated Joe to follow their path and make a difference at the best he can.

  
We thank Joe, Seunghee and CLC for the beautiful solidarity. The Korean Council will work towards just resolution of the Japanese military sexual slavery issue.
