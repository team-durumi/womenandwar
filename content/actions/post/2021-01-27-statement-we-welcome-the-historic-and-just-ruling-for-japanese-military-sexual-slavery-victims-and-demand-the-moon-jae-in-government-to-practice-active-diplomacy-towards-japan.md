We welcome the historic and just ruling for Japanese military sexual slavery victims. and demand the Moon Jae-in government to practice active diplomacy towards Japan!

On January 8, Seoul Central District Court Civil Chamber 34 ruled on the lawsuit filed by the Japanese military sexual slavery (“comfort women”) victims with a groundbreaking decision which declared that universal human rights take precedence over state immunity. After the victims’ persistent activism, a South Korean court finally announced a ruling recognizing the legal responsibilities of Japan. A path to justice has opened for victims, who campaigned around the world for the past 30 years calling for “no more victims like us.” The decision is significant in opening paths to remedy the rights of not only the plaintiffs but also survivors of sexual violence in armed conflicts and is drawing attention from around the world for its implications on international human rights law.

The court ruled that states and individuals are separate legal entities, and that the state cannot extinguish the rights of an individual under political ‘agreements.’ For both the 1965 Agreement on the Settlement of Problems concerning Property and Claims and on Economic Co-operation between the Republic of Korea and Japan and the 2015 Korea-Japan “comfort women” agreement, the court ruled that “it cannot be concluded that the plaintiffs' right to claim damages has been finally and irreversibly resolved” and that the 2015 agreement is “limited to declaring that there was a state-to-state political agreement on the issue of ‘comfort women’ between Korea and Japan.” In December 2019, the Constitutional Court of Korea also ruled that the victims’ rights and the diplomatic protection rights of the Korean government were not extinguished by the 2015 agreement. These rulings urge the Korean government to make efforts to hold the Japanese government legally responsible for resolving the Japanese military sexual slavery issue.

However, President Moon Jae-in said at the New Year’s press conference on January 18 that he was “perplexed” about the ruling. We are shocked and devastated over the president’s words regarding the historic ruling made possible by the victims’ 30-year-long fight.

His remark that “recognizes the 2015 agreement as the official agreement between the two governments” also contradicts remarks that the Moon Jae-in government had made since inauguration. The Moon Jae-in government declared that the 2015 agreement is not a resolution to the issue through a statement by the Minister of Foreign Affairs in 2018, dissolved the Reconciliation and Healing Foundation, and pursued the return of 1 billion JPY. In a luncheon at the Blue House attended by the victims in 2018, he said that “the past agreement is against the principles of truth and justice and is wrong in both its contents and procedures.”

We are compelled to ask what has changed the Moon Jae-in government to adjust its stance to not comply with “truth and justice” that it had emphasized thus far.

The Japanese government insisted that the Japanese military “comfort women” issue has been finally and irreversibly resolved by the 2015 agreement, repeatedly denied the truths of the crimes, severely defamed the victims, and systematically interfered with the installment of and demanded the removal of Statues of Peace around the world, including the Berlin Statue of Peace. The Japanese government even took the lead in erasing history, denying the very existence of systemic sexual slavery, forced mobilization, and illegal colonization. This is the reality of the 2015 agreement.

We call on Japan to no longer lie to the world and to apologize in an official and irreversible manner. The crimes against humanity that Japan had inflicted in Asia during the Second World War violated the universal value of human rights. It would be insufficient even if the victims were given billions of dollars or received apologies for hundreds or thousands of years. We hope that Japan would not lose the last opportunity to resolve the issue by making reparations in accordance with the ruling and actively pursuing acknowledgment of crimes, official apology, investigation of truth, and education of future generations that citizens around the world have called for.

This year marks the 30th anniversary of late Kim Hak-soon halmoni’s publicly coming forward as a survivor on August 14, 1991. After her first public testimony, numerous victims came forward and shared their messages with the world, paving the road towards justice.

The Moon Jae-in government should reflect deeply on the significance of this ruling and no longer remain passive. The Korean government should demand that Japan fulfill its legal responsibilities. We sincerely hope that the last door of opportunity opened by the Korean Judiciary will not be closed in vain by the Korean government.

- The Korean government should clarify the reasoning and meaning of calling the “2015 agreement” an “official agreement.”
- The Korean government should practice active diplomacy towards Japan to realize a victim-centered approach.
- The Korean government should respect the ruling of the judiciary and take the lead in the just resolution of the Japanese military sexual slavery issue!
- The Japanese government should admit its war crimes and officially apologize to the victims.
- The Japanese government should stop distortion of history and truth.
- The Japanese government should join the path towards peace and human rights through continuous investigation of truth and history education.
