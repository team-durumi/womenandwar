**General comment:**  
J. Mark Ramseyer of Harvard Law School published a journal article in which he falsely claimed that the women and girls forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese Imperial Army had “willingly entered into contracts.” Academics, politicians, and academics alike condemned the article, noting the total lack of evidence to support Ramseyer’s claims. Scholars have also noted the parallels between Ramseyer’s arguments and those of Japanese “ultra conservatives” who refuse to acknowledge the war crimes of the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II. The article has emerged as a flashpoint in the conflict between bad-faith historical revisionists and the narratives of surviving “comfort women” and their supporters.

In March, the _Asia Pacific Journal: Japan Focus_ published a special issue pertaining to the “comfort women” issue, largely in response to the Ramseyer article. In a series of supplemental letters, scholars such as Professors Alexis Dudden, Carter Eckert, Andre Gordon, and Tessa Morris-Suzuki, among others, wrote responses noting the fundamental flaws in Ramseyer’s piece, with Prof. Dudden calling the Ramseyer article an “[abuse of history](https://apjjf.org/2021/5/Dudden.html).”
