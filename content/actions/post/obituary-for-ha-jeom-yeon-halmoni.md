Ha Jeom-yeon halmoni was born in Hadong, Gyeongsangnamdo in 1922. When she was 15 years old, she went to her sister's house in Osaka, Japan, to help her look after her nephew. After 5 months, she was crying in front of the house because she missed her mother back home. A neighbor promised to bring her back home in Korea. When Ha Jeom-yeon halmoni went out to the meeting place without telling her sister, the Japanese woman took her.

She suffered from Japanese military sexual slavery in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Guangdong in China, Sumatra in Indonesia, and other locations.

She could not return home after the war ended. She arrived to Busan in 1946. She reported to the Korean Council in 1992 and registered in 1993. After that she attended the Wednesday Demonstration and participated in the human rights camp. In 2016, she moved to the House of Sharing.

She continued to exercise, even with the walking frame. Yet her health worsened over time and passed away in the morning of October 26th.

Halmoni, please rest in peace.\[/vc\_column\_text\]\[spacing desktop\_height="50" mobile\_height="30" smobile\_height="20"\]\[/vc\_column\]\[/vc\_row\]
