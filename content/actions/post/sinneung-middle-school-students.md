On December 11th and 18th, Sinneung Middle School donated 713,620 won to the Hands in Hands with 200,000 Japanese Military Sexual Slavery Victims campaign.

In 2017, Sinneung Middle School donated fund from selling hand-made badges after learning about the Japanese military sexual slavery issue at school. Students continued the solidarity with the victims through selling hand-made badges and promoting the issue of Japanese military sexual slavery through running a booth during the school festival.

Through flee market in July and festival in November, Sinneung Middle School students organize a booth and donate the profit. The students also made Statue of Peace with clay and held an exhibition at school.

We sincerely thank the students from Sinneung Middle School for standing in solidarity with the victims through various activities and for continuing their support.
