The Butterfly Fund works with organizations that support survivors of sexual violence in conflict in Uganda.

On the first day of 2019, the Golden Women Vision in Uganda sent a warm New Year's Greeting to warm our hearts.

Dear Yoon Mee-hyang  
On Behalf of Golden women vision in Uganda,l would like to extend my  
Great thanks to you for the very kind kind heart in supporting the  
war survivors in the Republic of Uganda in 2018 through the Butterfly  
Fund. it made the lives of my fellow war survivors to have Hope in  
their lives. this is simply because they thought they had no reason to  
live. But Now, they can still push a little bit in life and at this  
Time, they can manage to eat meals out of the craft work they are  
trained for and many others.  
By this recommendation,we pray to continue working together through  
out for the lives of our fellow Human Beings human rights Dignity.  
may you stay blessed through out your life.  
Regards,
