A debut poet, Emily Jungmin Yoon wrote about the experiences of the Japanese military sexual slavery victims. _A Cruelty Special to Our Species_, captured the readers through Emily Jungmin Yoon's own "experience of 'intertwined languages' and the postwar Korean diaspora" as described in the New York Times : [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/books/review/cruelty-special-to-our-species-emily-jungmin-yoon.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/books/review/cruelty-special-to-our-species-emily-jungmin-yoon.html)

In addition to using poetry to help the readers communicate with the victims, Emily Jungmin Yoon organized a fundraising campaign with her readers through Twitter : [https://twitter.com/EmilyYoon/status/1088152666193186817](https://twitter.com/EmilyYoon/status/1088152666193186817)

As her readers shared their minds to stand in solidarity with the victims of Japanese military sexual slavery, Emily Jungmin Yoon herself donated 1,000 dollars.

Emily's friend delivered the donation of 1,575 USD to the Korean Council on January 28th, 2019.

We thank Emily Jungmin Yoon, her friend David Krolikoski, and the readers for organizing this wonderful campaign. Please take a look at _A Cruelty Special to Our Species_ if you are in the bookstore.
