On September 18th, Yoon Meehyang, representative of the Korean Council, gave a special speech at the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.

The San Francisco Board of Supervisors had passed a resolution to install a memorial to honor the Japanese military ‘comfort women' victims on September 22nd, 2015, which led to the actual installation on September 22nd, 2017.

SFSU profess Eric Mar, who served as a member of the board back in 2015, had proposed the resolution. Member of the board Sandra Lee Fewer helped creating a space for the Korean Council for Justice and Remembrance to give the special speech.

On September 19th, Yoon Meehyang, representative of the Korean Council, gave a lecture on the historical truth of the Japanese military sexual slavery and the movement to resolve the issue in Prof. Jinsoo An's Korean 187 class at UC Berkeley.

Prior to the lecture, the students watched _The Apology_ to learn about the stories of Gil Won-ok halmoni from Korea, Cao halmoni from China, and Adela halmoni from the Philippines.

The students showed great interest in the Wednesday Demonstration, War and Women's Human Rights Museum, and the Butterfly Fund, and expressed their solidarity.

The Korean Council visited the East Asian Library and discussed ways to collaborate with the library in the future.
