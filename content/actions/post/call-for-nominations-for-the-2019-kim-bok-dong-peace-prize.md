The Korean Council for Justice and Remembrance for the Issues of Military Sexual Slavery by Japan (The Korean Council) calls for nominations of individuals or organizations for the 2019 Kim Bok-dong Peace Prize. Kim Bok-dong Peace Prize honors individuals or organizations that have been engaged in the movement to resolve the issue of sexual violence in armed conflict and ensure women’s human rights in armed conflict across the world. The Korean Council receives nominations till Friday, 26 April, 23:59 (Korea Standard Time) and will announce the winner on Wednesday 8 May through press release. The winner will be invited to attend the Korean Council’s event for the International Day for the Elimination of Sexual Violence in Conflict (19 June) in mid-June in Republic of Korea to receive the plaque and prize money of 5,000USD. The award ceremony will take place at the 1392nd Wednesday Demonstration for the Resolution of the Japanese Military Sexual Slavery Issue on 19 June, 2019.

**Establishment Background**

After her testimony as a Japanese military sexual slavery victim in 1992, Kim Bok-dong has been in the center of the movement for resolution of the Japanese military sexual slavery issue and supported victims of sexual violence in conflict till she passed away on 28 January 2019. When she won the Women’s Human Rights Award from the Foundation for Justice and Remembrance for the Issue of Military Sexual Slavery by Japan on 25 November 2017, she donated the prize money to be used for “the future generation to remember the lives of victims who have fought for resolution of the Japanese military sexual slavery issue and to support victims of sexual violence in armed conflict across the world.”

The Korean Council established the Kim Bok-dong Peace Prize to follow Kim Bok-dong’s spirit for peace and women’s human rights and to commemorate the International Day for the Elimination of Sexual Violence in Conflict (19 June). The Korean Council aims to raise international awareness of sexual violence in armed conflict and to encourage victims to become a part of women’s human rights movement by providing support to them until the violence against women in armed conflict ends. The Korean Council hopes that the Kim Bok-dong Peace Prize could give all women’s human rights organizations and activists an opportunity to remember everyone who has been engaged in the movement to end sexual violence in armed conflict.

The 1st Kim Bok-dong Peace Prize was awarded to Acan Sylvia Obal (Golden Women Vision in Uganda) who supports victims of the Lord’s Resistance Army conflict in Uganda. She received the prize from Kim Bok-dong when she visited Korea for the 6th International Memorial Day for Japanese Military ‘Comfort Women’ and has continued her activities in Uganda.
