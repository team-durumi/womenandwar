Subin Sim, a student at an international school in Vietnam, learned about the Japanese military sexual slavery issue and the victims of sexual violence by the Korean military during the U.S. War in Vietnam through reading the book _25 Years of Wednesdays_.

In order to stand in solidarity with the victims of both issues, she and members from Les Papillons (a group for Korean students attending international schools) created badges representing the Japanese military 'comfort women' victims and sold them to people from the school and the neighborhood for 50,000VND (approximately 2500KRW).

After the fundraising event, Les Papillons donated to the profit of 711,480KRW to the Korean Council on March 1st, 2019.

We sincerely thank Subin Sim and Les Papillons for listening to the voices of Japanese military sexual slavery victims and victims of sexual violence by the Korean military during the U.S. War in Vietnam. The Korean Council will continue to work for the resolution of the Japanese military sexual slavery issue and prevention of sexual violence in conflict across the world.
