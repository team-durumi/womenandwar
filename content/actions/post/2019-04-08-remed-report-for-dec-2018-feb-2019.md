On January 11th, the first sewing machine training was attended by 63 trainees who were girl-mothers (girls who became pregnant and gave birth due to sexual violence by the armed rebel groups) and women who flew from villages of Goma, Beni, and other regions due to Ebola and war.

Besides the training, REMED also plans to hold basic reading/writing classes and teach how to raise cattle to the women.

REMED has supported 20 children of the survivors from the Ushirika Women (group of survivors of sexual violence in conflict) to elementary school. Yet more than 40 children still need help to attend schools.

The lack of functioning sewing machines, classroom spaces, and basic needs such as food, clothing, and medicines is still a challenge.
