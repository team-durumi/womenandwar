On August 14, 1991, Kim Hak-soon came forward to share her experiences as a Japanese military “comfort woman.” To remember the courageous testimony of Kim Hak-soon and to work for human rights and dignity of all victims, organizations working for resolution of the Japanese military sexual slavery issue proclaimed August 14 as the International Memorial Day for Japanese Military "Comfort Women" at the 11th Asian Solidarity Conference for Resolution of the Japanese Military "Comfort Women" Issue in 2012. This year, we commemorate the 10th International Memorial Day.

Join us for the 10th International Memorial Day for Japanese Military "Comfort Women" to seek just resolution of the Japanese military "comfort women" issue and strive for a peaceful world.

#### 2\. **Register to receive Exhibit Panel on 10th International Memorial Day for Japanese Military "Comfort Women"**

The Korean Council for Justice and Remembrance for the Issues of Military Sexual Slavery by Japan created an exhibit panel on why we should remember the Japanese military sexual slavery issue together in light of the 10th International Memorial Day for Japanese Military "Comfort Women." The 10-page panel covers historical denialists interfering with the Wednesday Demonstration that has continued for over 30 years to seek justice on the issue and the global network of historical denialism across Korea, Japan, and the United States. The panel will inspire readers to face history together and remember the courage of victims against historical denialists who attempt to erase history.  Furthermore, the panel features multimedia sources easily accessible via QR codes.
